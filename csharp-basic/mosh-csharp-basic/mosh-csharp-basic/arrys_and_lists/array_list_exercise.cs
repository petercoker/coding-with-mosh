            //1 - When you post a message on Facebook, depending on the number of people who like your post, Facebook displays different information.

            //    If no one likes your post, it doesn't display anything.
            //    If only one person likes your post, it displays: [Friend's Name] likes your post.
            //    If two people like your post, it displays: [Friend 1]
            //and[Friend 2] like your post.
            //    If more than two people like your post, it displays: [Friend 1], [Friend 2] and[Number of Other People] others like your post.
